     <h3>About Myself</h3>
     <p>
      <br>Hi My name is Shreyas Sahu. I am 19 years old. I am a student at Queen Mary doing BSc Computer Science.</br> 
     </p>
     <p1>
     <br>In addition to this, I am part of an EECS school in QMUL, where EECS stands for electronic engineering and computer science.</br>  
     </p1>

     <p2>
      <br>Before enrolling to Queen Mary, I was fascinated about doing calculations and solving unexpected problems in Maths and 
     science because I did Maths, Physics, and Chemistry at A-levels.</br>
     </p2>

     <p3>
      <br>I had no knowledge about programming.</br>
     </p3>

     <p4>
      <br>However, when I started the first semester, I was captivated of learning how to 
     program and how that programming skills are applied in real-life.</br>
     </p4>

     <p5>
      <br>As I kept exploring new concepts in my course, I was also captivated of how logical thinking is applied in computational
     areas.</br>
     </p5>

     <p6>
      <br>Right now, I am looking forward to learn more programming languages.</br>
