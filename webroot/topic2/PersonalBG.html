     <h3>About Myself</h3>
     Hi My name is Shreyas Sahu. I was born in east London. I am 19 years old. I went to a secondary school called Chadwell Heath Academy
     for 7 years. Now, I am a student at Queen Mary doing BSc Computer Science. In addition to this, I am part of an EECS school in QMUL,
     where EECS stands for electronic engineering and computer science. Before enrolling to Queen Mary, I was fascinated about Maths and 
     science and I had no knowledge about programming. However, when I started the first semester, I was captivated of learning how to 
     program and how that programming skills are applied in real-life.
